# Snap-Game


Using Python, Java or C++, simulate a simplified game of "Snap!" between two computer players using N packs of cards (standard 52 card, 4 suit packs).

 

The "Snap!" matching condition can be the face value of the card, the suit, or both. The program should ask:

(i)     How many packs to use (i.e. define N)

(ii)   Which of the three matching conditions to use

 

Run a simulation of the cards being shuffled, then played one card at a time from the top of a common draw pile.

 

When two matching cards are played sequentially, a player is chosen randomly as having declared "Snap!" first and takes ownership of all cards played in that run.


Play continues until the common draw pile is completely exhausted (any cards played without ending in a "Snap!" at the time the draw pile is exhausted are ignored).

 

Tally up the total number of cards each player has accumulated and declare the winner/draw.
